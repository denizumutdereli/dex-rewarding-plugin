# Medium Issues


## M-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners 

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

- Found in contracts/Reward.sol [Line: 24](contracts\Reward.sol#L24)

	```solidity
	        return (size > 0);
	```



## M-2: Using `ERC721::_mint()` can be dangerous

Using `ERC721::_mint()` can mint ERC721 tokens to addresses which don't support ERC721 tokens. Use `_safeMint()` instead of `_mint()` for ERC721.

- Found in contracts/MockErc20.sol [Line: 9](contracts\MockErc20.sol#L9)

	```solidity
	        _mint(msg.sender, 5000000 * 10 ** decimals()); 
	```

- Found in contracts/MockErc20.sol [Line: 13](contracts\MockErc20.sol#L13)

	```solidity
	        _mint(to, amount);
	```

- Found in contracts/MockUSDC.sol [Line: 9](contracts\MockUSDC.sol#L9)

	```solidity
	        _mint(msg.sender, 5000000 * 10 ** 6); 
	```

- Found in contracts/MockUSDC.sol [Line: 13](contracts\MockUSDC.sol#L13)

	```solidity
	        _mint(to, amount);
	```



# Low Issues

## L-1: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

- Found in contracts/Dex.sol [Line: 60](contracts\Dex.sol#L60)

	```solidity
	    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public totalShortPool;
	```

- Found in contracts/Dex.sol [Line: 122](contracts\Dex.sol#L122)

	```solidity
	        uint256 currentPeriod = getPeriod();
	```

- Found in contracts/Dex.sol [Line: 164](contracts\Dex.sol#L164)

	```solidity
	            traderPositionsPerPeriod[_msgSender()][currentPeriod].short = newShortPosition;
	```



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in contracts/Dex.sol [Line: 2](contracts\Dex.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```

- Found in contracts/MockErc20.sol [Line: 2](contracts\MockErc20.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.17;
	```

- Found in contracts/MockUSDC.sol [Line: 2](contracts\MockUSDC.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.17;
	```

- Found in contracts/Reward.sol [Line: 2](contracts\Reward.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```



## L-3: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in contracts/Dex.sol [Line: 2](contracts\Dex.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```

- Found in contracts/MockErc20.sol [Line: 2](contracts\MockErc20.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.17;
	```

- Found in contracts/MockUSDC.sol [Line: 2](contracts\MockUSDC.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.17;
	```

- Found in contracts/Reward.sol [Line: 2](contracts\Reward.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```



# NC Issues

## NC-1: Functions not used internally could be marked external



- Found in contracts/MockErc20.sol [Line: 12](contracts\MockErc20.sol#L12)

	```solidity
	    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
	```

- Found in contracts/MockUSDC.sol [Line: 12](contracts\MockUSDC.sol#L12)

	```solidity
	    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
	```

- Found in contracts/MockUSDC.sol [Line: 16](contracts\MockUSDC.sol#L16)

	```solidity
	    function decimals() public view virtual override returns (uint8) {
	```



## NC-2: Constants should be defined and used instead of literals



- Found in contracts/MockErc20.sol [Line: 9](contracts\MockErc20.sol#L9)

	```solidity
	        _mint(msg.sender, 5000000 * 10 ** decimals()); 
	```

- Found in contracts/MockUSDC.sol [Line: 9](contracts\MockUSDC.sol#L9)

	```solidity
	        _mint(msg.sender, 5000000 * 10 ** 6); 
	```

- Found in contracts/MockUSDC.sol [Line: 17](contracts\MockUSDC.sol#L17)

	```solidity
	        return 6;
	```
